    <p>Like the classic Fried Rice, this rice dish is a Chinese delicacy. It is made up mainly of rice, eggs, vegetables, and spices.
        Egg Fried Rice is very flexible and easy to make. It is a great meal to quickly and easily whip up with leftover white rice and ingredients.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>5 cups white rice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric (or curry powder)</li>
        <li>300g of mixed vegetables (Carrots, Peas, Spring Onions, Red/Green Bell Peppers)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vinegar (optional)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 Seasoning Cubes</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and boil your rice with a little salt until it is well cooked. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat 2 eggs in one bowl and set aside; this will be used to garnish the food (but you can skip this and mix all the eggs if you prefer not to garnish).</li>
        <li>Beat the other 3 eggs in another bowl, along with 2 tablespoons water, black pepper, salt, and seasoning. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil. Pour the 2 beaten eggs (the one without the spices) and scramble them. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Then heat the pan over high heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the diced onion and mixed vegetables. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, add the rice and stir-fry for 2 minutes, stirring the rice uniformly to break up any clumps.</li>
        <li>Then, pour the uncooked egg (the one with the spice mixture) over the rice, and stir-fry for about 1 minute, until all the rice grains are coated in egg.
            Sprinkle in vinegar if you want to get rid of the egg smell. </li>
        <li>Stir-fry continuously for another minute. Next add soy sauce, garlic, salt, seasoning and chili sauce over the rice and mix.</li>
        <li>If the rice looks a little dry, sprinkle in some water or chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Mix in the scrambled eggs to garnish.</li>
        <li>Keep stir-frying lightly for a final 2-3 minutes until cooked through and serve.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pro tips to Note</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter will give your rice the very best flavor. But if you prefer, you can use just oil.</li>
        <li>Rice should be cooked ahead and allowed to cool(if you prefer using cooked rice).</li>
        <li>Use any veggies you like; fresh instead of frozen.</li>
    </ul>
